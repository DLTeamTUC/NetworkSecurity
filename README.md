# NetworkSecurity

Here we stored our codes for our project "Deep Learning for Network Security"

In the folder "DLBotnetDetection" you can find the codes for Deep Learning Techniques such as CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and MLP as a botnet detection. We use the CTU-13 dataset, therefore, please dowload the CTU-13 dataset here: https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13

Please refer to our paper for more details:
